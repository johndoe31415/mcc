Control statements are always followed by a single space.
if (...
for (...
while (...

Binary operators have a single space to the left and right.
a = q + 4;

Variablenames are always lowercase.
int attrib;

Classnames are always capitalized.
class Foo {
}

Condition fragments have to be in brackets.
if ((a && b) || (c && d)) {
}

Code blocks should always have explicit curly braces.
if (condition) {
	a = b;
}
else {
	a = c;
}

Between function definitions there is always exactly one empty line.
void foo() {
}

void bar() {
}
